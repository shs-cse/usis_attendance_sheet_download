# Auto-Download Attendance Sheets From USIS

This is intended for coordinates maintaining a lot of course-sections. 
Repeatedly downloading attendance sheets for each individual section can be a bit painful. 
This script is here to automate that for you.

Log into `USIS`, then go to the `Attendance` tab and select either `(before confirmation)` or `(after confirmation)`.
Select academic year, semster and course. 
Then run this script.

Since this script is going to download a lot of attendance sheet files, chrome will likely block pop-ups.
Check the right end of the address bar, and there should be an icon indicating that.
Click on it and then select `Allow all pop-ups from usis.bracu.ac.bd`.
